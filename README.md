## Code Description

The code for the Pivot Points Master EA is written in MQL5 language. It includes various functions and settings to calculate pivot points, integrate artificial intelligence, ensure compatibility with assets, and simulate trading.

### Pivot Points Calculation

The `CalculatePivotPoint` function calculates the pivot point based on the previous high, low, and close prices. It returns the pivot point value.

### Artificial Intelligence Integration

The `CalculateForecast` function utilizes artificial intelligence to predict the next price level. It calculates the forecast value by adding the difference between the pivot point and the previous close to the pivot point.

### Compatibility with Assets

The `IsMajorUSIndex` function checks if the symbol corresponds to a major US index (US100, US500, or US30). It returns a boolean value indicating whether the symbol is a major US index or not.

### Limited Edition Tool

The EA includes a limited edition feature that restricts the maximum number of copies available for purchase. The `MaxCopies` variable specifies the maximum number of copies, while the `CurrentCopies` variable keeps track of the currently sold copies. The `CopyPrice` variable represents the initial price of each copy, and the `CopyPriceIncrement` variable determines the increment in price for each subsequent copy sold.

### Default Settings

The `DefaultPivotPoint` and `DefaultPreviousClose` variables store the default values for the pivot point and previous close prices, respectively.

### Main Function

The `OnTick` function is the main function of the EA and is executed on every tick. It performs the following tasks:

1. Retrieves the current symbol using the `Symbol` function.
2. Checks if the symbol corresponds to a major US index using the `IsMajorUSIndex` function. If not, the function returns.
3. Retrieves the previous high, low, and close prices.
4. Calculates the pivot point and forecast using the `CalculatePivotPoint` and `CalculateForecast` functions, respectively.
5. Updates the `DefaultPreviousClose` variable for the next tick.
6. Prints the pivot point and forecast values.
7. Checks if there are available copies based on the `CurrentCopies` and `MaxCopies` variables.
8. If there are available copies, it prints the number of available copies and the copy price.
9. Simulates trading with the Pivot Points Master system (simulation code is not provided).
10. Increases the `CurrentCopies` variable and adjusts the `CopyPrice` accordingly.
11. Checks if all copies have been sold and prints a message if that is the case.
